## üß© Problem Statement

> Design and develop an intelligent task management system that can:
> - Automatically classify tasks into categories (e.g., work, personal, urgent)
> - Predict task priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
> - Leverage NLP + ML for end-to-end automation
> - Provide visualization and model evaluation

## üìÖ 4-Week Development Plan

### ‚úÖ Week 1 ‚Äì Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Loaded sample task dataset
- Performed EDA (nulls, stats)
- Applied NLP preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization

### ‚úÖ Week 2 ‚Äì Feature Extraction & Task Classification
- Extracted features using TF-IDF
- Built Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

### ‚úÖ Week 3 ‚Äì Priority Prediction & Workload Balancing
- Trained a Random Forest model for predicting task priority
- Evaluated and visualized results

### ‚úÖ Week 4 ‚Äì Finalization & Deployment
- Compiled outputs and visualizations
- Built a user-friendly Streamlit app
- Deployed online for demo access
